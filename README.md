# <h1 align="center">Hello World Tangle Blueprint üåê</h1>

## üìö Overview

This Tangle Blueprint provides a simple Hello World job.
Blueprints are specifications for <abbr title="Actively Validated Services">AVS</abbr>s on the Tangle Network. An AVS is
an off-chain service that runs arbitrary computations for a user-specified period of time.

Blueprints provide a useful abstraction, allowing developers to create reusable service infrastructures as if they were
smart contracts. This enables developers to monetize their work and align long-term incentives with the success of their
creations, benefiting proportionally to their Blueprint's usage.

For more details, please refer to the [project documentation](https://docs.tangle.tools/developers/blueprints/introduction).
